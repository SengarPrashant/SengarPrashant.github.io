                Currently I am associated with Larsen and Toubro as Lead software engineer. I oversee the building
                of innovative systems using Frontend and backend frameworks, React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3/SASS,
                JavaScript, C# .Net Core, Rest Apis, Micro services, SQL and related techonologies. With previous
                employers I was instrumental in structuring several internal systems and production workflow
                tracking, as well as designed custom REST APIs built in .Net Core and SQL. I also collaborate with
                our product owners, QA, marketing teams and other stakeholders to offer the best user experience and
                build higher customer lifetime value.

            </h5>
            In back-end development, my current stack involves C# .Net framework, .Net Core framework, Asp.Net, Rest
            Apis, SQL Server.
            <p class="pb-2 pt-2">
                Nearly every app I have launched in the past had the back-end done also by me. In order to improve the
                development speed, performance and reliability, I have changed languages and frameworks already multiple
                times and configured servers. The lessons I learned while doing all these apps will be useful for me
                forever, no matter what framework I will use in the next project.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-2">​What I can do for you at that side is:</p>
            <ul class="">

                <li>Refactoring existing applications, by improving code readibility, separating concerns into separate
                    functions/classes/modules, taking the business logic out from your request/response layer into
                    separate modules, and converting the app architecture.</li>
                <li>Leading, launching and monitoring the project.</li>
                <li>​​Writing unit cases.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="pb-2 pt-2">
                Thus, not only I have coded their back-end and front-end codebases, but often I also had to care about
                other things needed in a successful web application project:
            </p>
            <ul class="">
                <li>Collaboration with our product owners, QA, marketing teams and other stakeholders to finalize the

                <li>Good planning of UI and thinking how it affects the UX.</li>
                <li>Consistency in design.</li>
                <li>Mentoring and helping team members.</li>
                <li>In case if someone is missing from the project, fulfilling his role in order to meet the  project
                    timelines and keep an eye on blockers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="pb-2 pt-2">
                ​It's fine if your first thought is that I can't possibly be the best at everything. Send the design
                work to someone else, and I'll handle all of the coding, or any other function you think I'm best suited
                for.
